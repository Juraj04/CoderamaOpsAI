## FEATURE:

You will have to create new functionality for Users, Products and Orders modules.

### Users module:
    - new crud controller methods
    - uses Users table
    - User consist of name - max length 100, email max length 100 and unique, password string - this table and model should already be implemented
    - use dto for request/response
    - don't forget to hash password
    - handle correctly response - 400, 404 - user not found, 401 UnAuthorized
    - Result of creation is new item in db

### Products module:
    - new table Products, migration
        - id - autogenerated PK, name - string max length 100, description string, price - number, stock - number, created_at - utc timestamp
    - seed few testing data as part of migration
    - add crud controller methods
        - validation: price >= 0, stock >= 0 + validation as in database
    - use dto for request/response
    - handle correctly response - 400 - wrong request, 404 - product not found, 401 UnAuthorized

### Orders module:
    - new table Orders, migration
        Order has following fields: id autogenerated PK, user_id FK to Users table, total number >= 0, status enum (pending, processing, completed, expired) use enum to string conversion to db, product_id FK to Products table, quantity number > 0, price number > 0 created_at utc timestamp, updated_at utc timestamp
    - seed few data as part of migration
    - add crud controller methods
    - validation same as already described + not existing references to other tables
    - use dto for request/response
    - handle correctly response - 400 - wrong request, 404 - order not found, 401 UnAuthorized


### Common instructions:
    - all endpoints must be authenticated with bearer we get from Login method
    - include swagger documentation
    - update docker files if needed after migrations

### Testing
    - create unit tests for new controllers methods
    - copy folder structure of file which is being tested
    - test responses, if new entities created in db, Received count of services if any
    - use existing DatabaseTestBase for mock db


## EXAMPLES:

testing example: CoderamaOpsAI\CoderamaOpsAI.UnitTests\Api\Controllers\AuthControllerTests.cs
Login controller

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

check Claude.md for architectural and design principles and guidelines which should be followed.
